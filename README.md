## FAQ

#### Question 1
How can we best analyze and clean a given set of data acquired from a certain dataset?

Answer 1
We can use Pandas which is a Python library which can really help us do the magic in cleaning and analysing our data.
#### Question 2
How best can we do data visualisation on a set of data given?

Answer 2
We can use Data Visualisation tools such as Matplolib and Seaborn to help us in drawing of visualization graphs which can really help a great deal in seeing how the data varies with different visualization tools. 

## Appendix

- Conclusion
It's evident from our visualization that movies that had a lower average rating of below 5 had a bigger audience than those that had higher ratings.

Also if you would compare the number of votes with the average rating it gives a NO Correration. Meaning that there was no concrete relationship between the average rating and the number of votes

- Recommendation
It can be recommendend from our analysis that when choosing a movie type to dwell on, it would be adviserable if one didn't consider on obtaining a high rating and rather dwell on coming up with a script that best entertains the majority of the people without having a lot of complexities for the viewers to unpack on.
